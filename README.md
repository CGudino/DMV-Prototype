Quick prototype I built for one of my friends for an idea he has. It's an app where you select which DMV you are at, you put in your ticket number, and the app would request information from the DMV to keep the app updated on what ticket is currently being served. This would allow people at the DMV to leave without worrying about missing their ticket number.
